        z-Scores are standardized values that can be used to compare scores in
        different distributions.

        Take this example: For the past two years, Joe has been in a bowling
        league.
      </Text>
      <Text>First Year Stats:</Text>
      <Text>League Average = 181</Text>
      <Text>Standard Deviation = 12</Text>
      <Text>Joe's Score in Final Game = 187</Text>
      <Text>Second Year Stats:</Text>
      <Text>League Average = 182</Text>
      <Text>Standard Deviation = 5</Text>
      <Text>Joe's Score in Final Game = 185</Text>
      <Text>
        Compared to the rest of the league, in which year was Joeï¿½s score in the
        final game better?

        We can then plot the z-scores and compare their placement on the
        distribution. From the graphs below you can see that compared to the
        rest of the league, Joe had a better score in his second year.
